1. Identify tools that will allow you to do the following:

Scan infrastructure as code templates

twistcli (part of prisma cloud) - https://docs.paloaltonetworks.com/prisma/prisma-cloud/prisma-cloud-admin/prisma-cloud-devops-security/secure-your-infrastructure-automation.html
AnchoreCLI -  https://github.com/anchore/anchore-cli

2. Example vulnerability

TwistCLI:
"The twistcli images scan function collects information about the packages and binaries in the container image, and then sends it to Console for analysis.
Data collected by twistcli includes:
	Packages in the image.
	Files installed by each package.
	Hashes for files in the image.
After Console analyzes the image for vulnerabilities, twistcli:
	Outputs a summary report.
	Exits with a pass or fail return value."

Anchore:
anchore-cli image vuln docker.io/library/debian:latest os

3. Scan AMIâ€™s or containers for OS vulnerabilities
